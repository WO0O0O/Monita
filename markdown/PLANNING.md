3. **Daily practice**: Aim for at least 1-2 hours of coding every day
4. **Join communities**: Participate in r/flask, r/reactjs, and AWS forums for help
5. **Debug methodically**: Learn to use debugging tools in each technology
6. **Code reviews**: Consider having more experienced developers review your code
7. **Track progress**: Keep a learning journal to document what you've learned
