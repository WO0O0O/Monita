# UpMon Project Updates - March 8, 2025

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to the UpMon project on March 8, 2025. The primary focus was implementing real-time website monitoring functionality, fixing issues with the frontend and backend integration, and ensuring the dashboard displays accurate and up-to-date information.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Real-time Website Monitoring
- Implemented a background thread that checks website status every 60 seconds
- Added functionality to perform HTTP requests to verify if websites are up or down
- Created storage for website check history (up to 100 entries per website)

```python
# Function to check a website's status
def check_website(website):
    # Measure start time
    # Send HTTP request to the website
    # Calculate response time
    # Determine status (up/down)
    # Store results in history
    # ...
```

### 2. Dashboard Statistics Endpoint
- Added a new API endpoint: `/api/dashboard` to provide aggregate statistics
- Returns total websites, up/down counts, and average response time

```python
@app.route('/api/dashboard', methods=['GET'])
def get_dashboard_stats():
    # Calculate statistics from check history
    # Return aggregated data as JSON
    # ...
```

### 3. Improved Website Status Endpoint
- Enhanced the `/api/websites/<id>/status` endpoint to return real monitoring data
- Returns actual status, response time, status code, and check history
- Performs an immediate check if no history exists

## Frontend Changes

### 1. Dashboard Component
- Updated to fetch data from the dashboard stats endpoint
- Increased refresh rate to 15 seconds (from 30 seconds)
- Fixed the display of "Last Checked" timestamp
- Removed unused variables

```javascript
// Load website data and stats
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    // Fetch websites and dashboard stats in parallel
    const [websitesData, statsData] = await Promise.all([
      getWebsites(),
      getDashboardStats()
    ]);
    // ...
  };
  // Refresh every 15 seconds
  const interval = setInterval(fetchData, 15000);
  // ...
}, []);
```

### 2. Website Detail Component
- Fixed the display of "Last Checked" timestamp
- Added better handling for pending checks
- Removed unused imports (Divider)

### 3. API Service
- Added a new function to fetch dashboard statistics

```javascript
/**
 * Get dashboard statistics
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Dashboard statistics
 */
export const getDashboardStats = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get('/dashboard');
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching dashboard stats:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## How the Monitoring Works Now

1. **Initial Setup**: When the Flask backend starts, it initializes the monitoring thread
2. **Background Monitoring**: Every 60 seconds, all registered websites are checked
   - Each website is checked using HTTP requests
   - Response times, status codes, and up/down status are recorded
   - Results are stored in an in-memory history (up to 100 entries per website)

3. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Dashboard automatically refreshes every 15 seconds
   - Website detail pages refresh every 30 seconds
   - Status history is available on the website detail page

4. **Data Flow**:
   - Backend periodically checks websites and stores results
   - Frontend periodically fetches latest data through API endpoints
   - UI components display the most recent data

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Implement SQLite database to store website data and check history
2. **Email/SMS Alerts**: Add notification system for when websites go down
3. **Custom Check Intervals**: Allow setting different check intervals for each website
4. **Performance Metrics**: Add more detailed performance metrics and trend analysis
5. **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and authentication
